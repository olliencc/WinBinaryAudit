# WinBinaryAudit .NET library

This is a .NET library for assessing the security properties of PE/COFF files.

Over the years it has had many names including:
* GSAudit at Symantec - used in Blackhat DC 2007 presentation
* ExeAudit at RIM/BlackBerry - internal 
* RECX Binary Assurance for Windows - http://www.recx.co.uk/products/exeaudit.php
* Windows Binary Analyzer at NCC Group - https://labs.nccgroup.com/NCCGroupWindowsBinaryAnalyzer/

5 versions later, still the same concept. This is the core .NET library now known as WinBinaryAudit.
